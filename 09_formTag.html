    <!-- login form -->
    <h1>login</h1>

    <form action="http://wikipedia.org">
        <input name = "username" type="text" placeholder="username">
        <input name = "password" type="password" placeholder="password">
        <input type="submit">
    </form>

    <!-- fill in a form and send a request to somewhere else,
        and then how to check that? 

        (1) add "action" in the form tag
        (2) after click the submit button, you will see this info in the web address bar
        - https://www.wikipedia.org/?username=lucky&password=iloveyou

        (3) therefore, successfully sent my request, using that form
        and, in that request, the data was extracted and sent along with the request

    -->
    
    <!-- when we submit the form, 
        the data is sent along with the request 
        and, there is a way to see that! How?
        (especially see a get-request this time, 
        but usually a post-request due to security reasons)

        (1) give "name" in the each input line
        (2) when you put data and press the submit button,
            the given data show up in the web address bar
        (3) question marks("?") are followed by the key-value pairs

        <form>
            <input name = "username" type="text" placeholder="username">
            <input name = "password" type="password" placeholder="password">
            <input type="submit">
        </form>
    
    -->

    <!-- how to add action and method? 

        - action : where the form send data to 
        - method : what HTTP method (get/post) 

        (1) add "action" & "method" in form tags!
        (2) then, send the request to the action page

        <form action="http://wikipedia.org" method="GET">
            <input type="text" placeholder="username">
            <input type="password" placeholder="password">
            <input type="submit">
        </form>

    -->

    <!-- if you write a word after the form tags,
        
        (1) inputs with form tags: block-level attribute, so on next line the letter is displayed.
                               if you click the submit button, forms are refreshed!

            <form>
                <input type="text" placeholder="username">
                <input type="password" placeholder="password">
                <input type="submit">
            </form>

        (2) inputs w/o form tags: inline, therefore letter is situated in the same input line. 
                              althoughj you click the submit button, forms remain with information

                <input type="text" placeholder="username">
                <input type="password" placeholder="password">
                <input type="submit">

    -->


    <!-- another ways to create submit button
        
        <input type="submit">
        <button>Submit</button> 
        
    -->
